## DATA SOURCE.
- MICROSOFT EXCEL
  
## TOOLS.
- MICROSOFT EXCEL
- SQL

## DATA EXPLORATION AND PREPARATION.
I began by performing an initial exploration of the data in excel. This involved cleaning the dataset to ensure accuracy and consistency, which is crucial for a reliable data analysis.

## EXCEL ANALYSIS.
- ### PIVOT TABLES: I utilised pivot tables to summarize total sales by product, region and month, providing a clear view of sales distribution

- ### METRICS CALCULATION: Employed excel formulas like ( SUM, AVERAGE) to calculate key performance metrics such as:
   - Total Sales: It is very important to firstly calculate the total sales as it would be vital in the determination of other metrics.

## SQL QUERIES.
I wrote SQL Queries to delve deeper into the sales data, allowing for more complex analyses using the following queries.

For a more specific overview, i was able to make the following analysis via the SQL server:
- Total Sales by Product Category: This revelaed which categories contribute most to overall revenue.
- Sales Transactions by Region: This helped identify regions with regions with high transaction volumes, highlighting potential areas for expansion or increased marketing focus.

- Highest- Selling Product: By determining the top selling products by total saless value, I could recommend products for promotion or beter stock management.
- Revenue per Product: Calculated the total revenue generated by each product, offering insights into product profitability.

## Power BI Visualization:
I created a dynamic dashboard in Power BI to visualize the insights gained from the Excel and SQL analyses. The dashboard includes:
	•	Sales Overview: A high-level summary of overall sales performance, making it easy to communicate key metrics to stakeholders.
 ![SALES OVERVIEW](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ddd1c3f-1f42-4d3b-8239-9a3c8cacc435)
	•	Top-Performing Products: A detailed view of the products that drive the most revenue, facilitating strategic decisions regarding promotions and inventory management.

	•	Regional Breakdowns: Visualizations that compare performance across different regions, helping to pinpoint successful areas and those needing attention.

 ## KEY INSIGHTS AND IMPLICATIONS.
- **Product Trends:** The analysis indicated that certain product categories consistently outperformed others, suggesting opportunities for targeted marketing and inventory focus.
- **Regional Performance Variability:** Significant discrepancies in sales performance between regions highlighted the need for tailored marketing strategies to address local preferences.
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Monthly sales trends revealed peak sales periods, enabling the retail store to optimize stock levels and marketing campaigns during high-demand seasons.
- **Customer Insights:** Understanding who the top customers are allows for the development of loyalty programs and personalized marketing efforts to enhance customer retention.

  ## RECOMMENDATIONS:
Based on the analysis of the retail store’s sales performance, I have outlined several strategic recommendations aimed at enhancing sales, improving inventory management, and optimizing marketing efforts:

1. Targeted Marketing Campaigns:

	•	Focus on Top-Selling Products: Develop marketing campaigns centered around the top-performing products identified in the analysis. Highlight these products in advertisements and promotions to capitalize on their popularity and drive additional sales.
	•	Regional Promotions: Implement localized marketing strategies tailored to the preferences and buying behaviors of customers in high-performing regions. Consider seasonal promotions that align with regional sales trends.

2. Inventory Optimization:

	•	Stock Management for High-Demand Products: Increase inventory levels for consistently top-selling products to avoid stockouts and lost sales opportunities. Use historical sales data to forecast demand more accurately.
	•	Review Underperforming Products: Analyze the products identified with no sales in the last quarter to determine if they should be phased out, discounted, or re-evaluated for improvements. This will help streamline the product offering and improve overall inventory efficiency.

3. Customer Engagement Strategies:

	•	Loyalty Programs for Top Customers: Develop a loyalty program targeting the top 5 customers identified in the analysis. Offer exclusive discounts, early access to new products, or personalized promotions to encourage repeat purchases.
	•	Feedback Mechanism: Implement a feedback system for customers to gather insights on their preferences and experiences. This can help tailor product offerings and improve customer satisfaction.
